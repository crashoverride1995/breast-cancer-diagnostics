# breast-cancer-diagnostics
The aim for the project is to take the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set available at UCI Machine Learning Repository and apply machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Multi-Layer Perceptron to extract features from the data set which could be the most suitable for predicting the nature of the cancer. The purpose is to classify breast cancer whether it is benign or malignant. Accuracy of the models based on their predictions is determined to analyze and compare the generated models to each other and select the best out of the model. Multi-Layer Perceptron is the most accurate model out of the models tested with 97.2% accuracy.
